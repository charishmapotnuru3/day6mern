* what is PEP8?
--> PEP 8 stands for Python Enhancement Proposal 8. It is a style guide for Python code, written by Guido van Rossum, Barry Warsaw, and Nick Coghlan.
    PEP 8 outlines coding conventions for writing Python code in a way that is easy to read and understand by other programmers.
  
   -Indentation: Using 4 spaces for indentation.
   -Line Length: Keeping lines of code to a maximum of 79 characters.
   -Import Statements: Importing modules on separate lines.
   -Naming Conventions: Following conventions for naming variables, functions, and classes.
   -Comments: Writing clear and concise comments to explain code.
   -Blank Lines: Using blank lines to separate sections of code logically.
   -Whitespaces: Using whitespaces appropriately around operators and after commas.
     
*what are operators? What is use of walrus operator?
-->Operators refer to special symbols that perform operations on values and variables. 
     Arithmetic Operators: +, -, *, /, %, // , **.
     Comparison Operators: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=.
     Logical Operators: and, or, not.
     Assignment Operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, //=, **=.
     Bitwise Operators: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>.
     Identity Operators: is, is not.
    -The walrus operator := is a relatively new addition to Python. It is also known as the assignment expression operator. The main purpose of the walrus operator
      is to assign a value to a variable as part of an expression. 
      -Ex:# Without walrus operator
            x = 10
           if x > 5:
              y = x * 2
           print(y)
*what is for loop?why for loop is used?
-->A for loop is a control flow statement in programming that allows you to iterate over a sequence  and execute a block of code for each item in the sequence.
   It is used for repetitive tasks where you want to perform the same operation on each element of a sequence.
        syntax:for item in sequence
        ex:fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
           for fruit in fruits:
           print(fruit)
-->use:
        -The loop starts by iterating over each item in the specified sequence.
        -For each iteration, the loop assigns the current item to the variable specified after the for keyword.
        -The indented code block beneath the for statement is then executed for each item in the sequence.

    













        

          # With walrus operator
           x = 10
           if (y := x * 2) > 5:
            print(y)
